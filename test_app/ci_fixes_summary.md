# CI/CD Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. RuboCop Violations (Exit Code 1) ✅
- Fixed syntax errors in `app/components/product_rating_component.rb` - incorrect block syntax
- Updated `.rubocop.yml` to set `TargetRubyVersion: 3.4` to match the project's Ruby version
- Fixed all trailing whitespace issues in `playground_controller.rb`
- Ran auto-correct on all files to fix formatting issues
- Result: All RuboCop violations in test_app are now resolved

### 2. ThreadSafety Cop Not Recognized (Exit Code 2) ✅
- Added `rubocop-thread_safety` gem to the parent Gemfile
- Updated `.rubocop.yml` to use `plugins:` syntax instead of `require:`
- Added both `rubocop-rails` and `rubocop-thread_safety` to plugins list
- Result: ThreadSafety cop now works correctly

### 3. Bundler Command Not Found (Exit Code 127) ✅
- Updated `.github/workflows/security.yml` to run `bundle install` in test_app directory
- Added a new step "Install test_app dependencies" before running security tests
- This ensures Rails and other dependencies are available when CI changes to test_app directory
- Result: CI should now be able to run Rails commands in test_app

## Changes Made

1. **test_app/.rubocop.yml**
   - Added `TargetRubyVersion: 3.4` under `AllCops`

2. **test_app/app/components/product_rating_component.rb**
   - Fixed incorrect block syntax (removed dangling `do` block)
   - Auto-corrected spacing and formatting issues

3. **Gemfile (parent directory)**
   - Added `gem 'rubocop-thread_safety', '~> 0.5', require: false`

4. **.rubocop.yml (parent directory)**
   - Changed from `require:` to `plugins:` syntax
   - Added `rubocop-thread_safety` to plugins list

5. **.github/workflows/security.yml**
   - Added bundle install step for test_app directory

## Next Steps

All reported CI failures should now be resolved. The CI pipeline should:
1. Run RuboCop successfully without violations
2. Recognize and run ThreadSafety cop
3. Execute Rails commands in test_app directory without bundler errors
